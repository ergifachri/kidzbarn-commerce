    "description": "This wonderful game builds thinking skills, starting out easy and progressing to harder puzzles so younger kids can develop skills as they go to solve increasingly challenging puzzles. The basic MightyMind game contains a tray with 32 colorful plastic design tiles and 30 sturdy puzzle boards. The puzzles are numbered so you can easily spot their correct order. While the first puzzles consist of spaces to match single shapes to, the puzzles reach a point where they have just an outline, requiring children to experiment with different pieces until they find the correct combination in order to solve the puzzle. Children can work their way through the puzzles without help, all the while building puzzle-working skill and interest. MightyMind has received several awards, among them the Parent's Choice Honor award. A magnetic version of MightyMind is also available, which includes magnetic shapes and is packaged in a tin. Great for the road! SuperMind is a sequel for children who have successfully completed the MightyMind puzzles. It is available separately (in original or magnetic versions), or you can purchase just the design book, since the design tiles are identical to those in the first set. Extra Design Tiles are available, 32 colored tiles in each set, so more than one child can play at once. These are also great for use without pattern cards to create freeform designs.",
