Here, you can find numerous high quality children books as well as curated educational toys.  \n\n                                            Our story began in 2017, when we initially offered imported Children books from world's most famous publishers.\n\n                                            \n                                        </div>\n                                        <div style={{lineHeight:'200%',opacity:0.85,textAlign:'center',marginTop:'20px',maxWidth:'900px'}}>\n                                            \n                                        Our deep interest in children books flourished as we personally acquired some of these books for our very own daughter, born just a year before.\n\nOur hope at the time had always been for her to grow the habit of reading high quality children books and playing less with toys. \n\nAs for toys, we didn't spend a lot in her early years. However, she initially had a few toys made from magnetic wooden blocks, namely TEGU.    \n                                        </div>\n\n                                        <div style={{lineHeight:'200%',opacity:0.85,textAlign:'center',marginTop:'20px',maxWidth:'900px'}}>\n                                            \n                                        This has been one of her favorite toys since then. \nAlong with this, we discovered that in the market, there were many sophisticated block toys and wooden toys that provide open-ended gameplay.\nWe thus started to source and market some of the toys in 2019, in addition to our book business. \n\nTherefore we continue to stay true to our course and expand it by providing best educational experiences to both parents and children, through great books and educational toys.\n </div>\n\n\n                                        \n                                    </div>\n

Here, you can find numerous high quality children books as well as curated educational toys.  \n\nOur story began in 2017, when we initially offered imported Children books from world's most famous publishers. \n\nOur deep interest in children books flourished as we personally acquired some of these books for our very own daughter, born just a year before.\n\nOur hope at the time had always been for her to grow the habit of reading high quality children books and playing less with toys. \n\nAs for toys, we didn't spend a lot in her early years. However, she initially had a few toys made from magnetic wooden blocks, namely TEGU. This has been one of her favorite toys since then. \nAlong with this, we discovered that in the market, there were many sophisticated block toys and wooden toys that provide open-ended gameplay.\nWe thus started to source and market some of the toys in 2019, in addition to our book business. \n\nTherefore we continue to stay true to our course and expand it by providing best educational experiences to both parents and children, through great books and educational toys.\n\nAs time passed, our online bookshop and toyshop grew with more customers from all over Indonesia. This has motivated us to continue to source only the best books and high quality toys for our market customers.  \n\nWe are strongly encouraged and truly excited to witness the growing awareness of the importance of good books among our growing and loyal customers. \n\nAt the same time, we are very thrilled to see the quality bonding time that our customers enjoy with their children when playing our toys.\n\nSubsequently, we have also built strong business relationship with our customers that we too have become friends to many of them over the years. \n\nAs our daughter is now enrolled to pre-school, we get to see that our book-reading to her, since her infancy, has brought her some evident benefits. She apparently has stronger communication and command-understanding skills than most of her peers. We believe that most of the books she has have provided a firm foundation in building her cognitive skills and knowledge curiosity. \n\nMoreover, as her pre-school program is montesorri-based, when she engages in some of the educational tools, she appears to be rather handy in grasping the teachers' instructions.\n\nApparently, not only the books are good for her, but also the educational toys. We observe that the toys have played several helpful roles in building up her creative and imaginative skills.\n\nWith all the valuable benefits our daughter has received from good books and high quality educational toys, it is therefore our sincere hope that they too can be a blessing to your wonderful child.\n\nAnd with your support, we hope to continue on this journey of excellence, a journey that provides the harmony of good books and best educational toys. \nThank you.</p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n
